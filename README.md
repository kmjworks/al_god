Based on these subjects, create me a cheat-sheet for an upcoming exam with examples,
code snippets, and explanations that I can use and port into solutions.

These topics are for C programming so they should be covered with relation to C.

For each cheat sheet or topic create a individual folder.

Topics to cover: 
1. Pointers
2. Enums
3. Structures
4. Header files
5. Qsort, dividing code and using libraries
6. Valgrind, Makefile, logging and library creation - snippets and how to use (portable) and how valgrind works
7. Dynamic memory allocation
8. Dynamic memory allocation 2: reallocation
9. Embedded systems - create a comprehensive cheat sheet
10. Recursion and stack - need a lot of examples and stuff for this as well.
11. Linked lists
12. Trees (binary etc.)
13. SQL
